/**
 * This class is the classic Quick Sort Example.

 * Runtime Complexity: 
 * 
 * In the best case, the algorithm will divide the list into two equal 
 * size sub-lists. So, the first iteration of the full n-sized list needs O(n). Sorting the remaining two sub-lists 
 * with n/2 elements takes 2*O(n/2) each. As a result, the QuickSort algorithm has the complexity of O(n log n).
